# Employee Absentism

This repo contains an example of HR Analytics - an Employee Absentism Dashboard created using Excel.

We attempt to highlight some good practices including:
* documentation;
* data check and removal of unsuited data;
* use of pivot tables as components to dashboards;
* use of background image and styling to provide a professional look-and-feel.

### Data Source
The data is based on the book "Doing HR Analytics - A Practitioner's Handbook with R Examples".

Data downloaded from: [https://www.kaggle.com/HRAnalyticRepository/absenteeism-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/HRAnalyticRepository/absenteeism-dataset)

Note that the data is ficticious - the author  used this to demonstrate analytics based on his book.


### Excel - Data Wrangling, Checks, Dashboarding
Excel was used to perform various data manipulations and checks, to create pivot tables which eventually form the two dashboards.
